# Fraud Detection 🔍💳

This repository contains a Fraud Detection project that utilizes Deep Learning and Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) Neural Networks to identify fraudulent activities in financial transactions. The project focuses on data preprocessing, visualization, and model training using advanced machine learning techniques.

## 📦 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available on my Kaggle page:
